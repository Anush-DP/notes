- Everything in JS is an object. (Except primitive types)
- Primitive types cannot be mutated
- 7 primitive types
    - `string` (Ex: "asd")
    - `number` (Ex: 1)
    - `null`
    - `undefined`
    - `bigint` (Ex: 42n)
    - `boolean` (Ex: true)
    - `symbol` (Ex: Symbol())
- `typeof null` is `object` because of a bug introduced in the beginning of JS and has not been fixed
- Dotting on primitive types (ex: `prim_type.toString()`) does autoboxing and connects the value to the corresponding objct prototype

# Prototypes
- Prototypes is the mechanism that powers inheritance within JS.
- There's no limit to the number of nested prototypes
